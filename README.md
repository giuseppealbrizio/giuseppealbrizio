# Hi there, I'm Giuseppe! 🙋🏻‍♂️

Senior Node.js developer building financial systems. Currently exploring what it means to be a developer when AI writes most of the code.

## 🔧 What I Do

**Production:** Node.js · MongoDB · Express · Mongoose @ Skeldon

**Exploring:** Python · FastAPI · LangChain · AI-assisted workflows

## 🧠 Current Focus

Transitioning from "how do I write this" to "should this exist at all" — the **Software Engineer 3.0** mindset. Less typing, more thinking.

- 📚 100 Python scripts journey (2025)
- 🛠️ AI toolstack: Claude Code · GitHub Copilot · Codex CLI
- ✍️ Building educational resources on AI-assisted development

## 💡 Philosophy

- Small diffs, reliable reviews
- Generation-verification loops over blind trust
- Quality gates are non-negotiable (lint, tests, security, types)
- Fundamentals help you *verify* AI output, not compete with it

## 🎛️ Background

Graduated in sound engineering \ still shapes how I think about signal, noise, and clean output.
